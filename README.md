# Side Projects Idea Collection
Simple collection of side project ideas I've in mind but never find time and would forget about it if I wouldn't write them down anywhere.

### Radio X concert Filter
Own JavaScript app or browser extension
http://mainstream.radiox.ch/konzerte

I really like this site because it shows all concerts in Switzerland of my taste in music. The downside is it doesn't provide any filters for city, dates, etc...

For a first version it would be enough to build a mirror and parse the content into a filterable format.

#### Regex-formats
- Date (Number)
- Band (String until comma)
- Venue (String until newline)

### Focus
Sometimes you have to "really" disconnect from the internet.
Blocks the internet for up to 8 hours (default) or any given time range.

Is there something like a network adapter to disable on unix?

### Meteor Chat mit groups, screennames and geolocation
A Chat app only with screennames, geolocation and groups.
Show who is around you.
Kinda like riddle.
Could be interesting calculating who is around based on their geolocation

### .archive

#### Requirements
- Twitter, GitHub API
- Twitter Bootstrap

#### Technology
- Meteor
- Django/Rails

#### Features
- Import Twitter Favorites & Github Stars
- Item list
- Tagging
- Search (AJAX)

### Startpage: Twitter, Facebook, Baz, Wetter, etc.
Not really useful but it could be a learning project to work with various APIs.
Maybe I could use embed.ly or something like that.

### App for App Ideas
Replace this list with an app. Maybe something like http://github.com/benhowdle89/thrift ?

### Read Later (Meteor)
Custom Read Later list. 
To save a link you could possibly use a javascript bookmark.

### Wetter status of your Hometown as Twitter-Avatar
Play with the Twitter API and Yahoo Weather API.

### Wunderlist Todos -> iCal Abo
Show my Todos with a due date in my Calendar App -> Wunderlist API.

### Excel-cms
Flat-file CMS with excel sheets.
Target group: People who ♥︎ excel.

### Rasperry Phone Blacklist
Push all incoming calls trough a Rasperry (RJ11) and block all numbers which are on a Blacklist.

### http://permeate.im Clone
Build a clone to see how the Twitter API works.

## Completed

### Wishlist
[https://github.com/mariuskueng/library-wishlist](https://github.com/mariuskueng/library-wishlist)

You've a list with music (or other media) which you would like to buy or borrow from your local library.
Just write it down and it shows you automatically if it's available.

#### Prototype
There is a small prototype which searches through the web interface (forms) because there is obviously no public API.
To improve this I could try out Mechanize.

As an extension it would be awesome to connect this list with the Wunderlist API (when it's available).


### Private Twitter/Day One clone for small thoughts (Meteor)
[https://github.com/mariuskueng/mainstream](https://github.com/mariuskueng/mainstream)

See the thoughtly project. It's more or less just a note app.
